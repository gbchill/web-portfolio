# My Portfolio Website

Hey! This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects, work experience, and skills as a software engineer and CS student at ASU.

## What's This?

Just a clean, modern portfolio site that highlights what I've been working on. You can check out my projects, see where I've worked, and get in touch if you want to connect.

Live site: [georgebadulescu.com](https://www.georgebadulescu.com)

## Tech Stack

Built with:
- **Next.js 16** - React framework for the web
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics and interactive elements
- **Vercel** - Hosting and deployment

## Running Locally

If you want to run this on your machine:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Deployment

The site automatically deploys to Vercel whenever I push to the main branch. Pretty convenient.
